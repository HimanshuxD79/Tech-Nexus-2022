# Tech-nexus
Tech-Nexus, a National Level Online Fest organized by NIT-Hamirpur, is a pristine platform that provides an amalgamation of innovation and learning. The Essence of Tech-Nexus is to connect all the technical minds across the nation and provide them a platform to express their skills and ideas. Being organized for the first time, the fest would be a great opportunity to kindle their imagination. Besides the fact that the fest aims to canvas the Technical Perspective of budding minds, it further imparts a realistic approach to showcase their ideas. While maintaining a positive environment, we aspire to provide exposure and let the future Tech-marvels face prelude to the corporate world.

This extravaganza would be preceded by live electrifying events like Esports, Hackathons, Guest Lecture, and many more exciting surprises. Instated to foster the vision of  reigniting the spark that has been extinguished by this pandemic, Tech-Nexus will be a gauge of technological eminence. With renowned personalities onboard, the fest promises a unique voyage full of innovation, networking and learning.
