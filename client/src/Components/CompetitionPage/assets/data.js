Mysteries, suspense, and the promise of something more without ever disclosing what that something is.
On January 4, 2012, the hardest puzzle on the internet was born: "Cicada 3301", which is believed to be the most "elaborated and mysterious puzzle of the internet age." No one knows who set it or what the prize is at the end, but Cicada 3301 has posted mysterious, extremely difficult puzzles for three years in a row, in an attempt to recruit and enlighten the best cryptanalysts from the public. <br>
Creating that mysterious era again, Tech-nexus brings you the cicada quiz, Gizem – perceiving the q-verse, in which participants navigate through a series of levels of cryptic riddles and decode the pictures to reach the end in a specific amount of time using hints from technical literature. The event will provide students with a platform to compete and test their skills against some of the greatest cryptic hunters and intellectuals in the country. Connect the dots, decode the hints, solve the mysteries, and unravel the clues to emerge victoriously. <br>
We look forward to meeting the few who will make it all the way through.<br>
